  // Uncomment/comment the below code blocks and modify the contents of file.txt
  // in order to test out the different examples of reading content from a file.

  // create an ifstream object
  ifstream inFile;

  // attempt to open file.txt
  inFile.open("file.txt");

  // if file.txt fails to open, fail() will return true, and we'll exit 
  // gracefully by telling the user what went wrong and exiting with status 1 
  // which is a signal to the shell that something wen't wrong in the execution
  // of our program

  // Assume file.txt contains the text:
  // 4
  //

  // variable to store number in the file
  //int number = 0;
  
  // attempt to read in the number
  //inFile >> number;

  // if we attempt to read in another number it will fail and we can also 
  // detect this using the fail() function 
  /*
  inFile >> number;

  // Attempt to read in a file with the format:
  // 1.1 1.2 1.3
  // 2.1 2.2 2.3
  // 3.1 3.2 3.3
  //
  // Notice howe can read in multiple values, also notice how we use the
  // eof() function to detect the end of a file... allowing us to process 
  // a file with an arbitrary number of lines, where each line has 3 
  // double values per line.

  // We could also store the values into a 2D array for usage later.  Notice 
  // how we use the stream extraction operator IN the while loop condition... 
  // it will return true when extraction is successful, and false when it is 
  // not (e.g. we reach the end of the file).  This is an alternative way of 
  // reading in the values from the file.  Also notice how we increment i 
  // in each iteration of the loop to store the values in the next row of the 
  // 2D array.
  //

    cout << a[j][1] << " ";
    cout << a[j][2] << endl;
  }

  // If the file contents are:
  // This is a string.
  // 
  // Then if we use the stream extraction operator, only the keyword "This" 
  // will be stored into line... because the operator will stop at the first 
  // whitespace character.  We can use getline() to read in the entire line 
  // including spaces, because it will stop at the first newline in the file.
  //
  /*
  string line;
  // inFile >> line;
  getline(inFile, line);
  cout << line << endl;

  // we close the file when we are done with it as a best practice, it also has
  // the effect of free-ing up some memory too
